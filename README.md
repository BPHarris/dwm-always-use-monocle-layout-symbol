# dwm-always-use-monocle-layout-symbol


# Description

A [dwm patch](https://suckless.org/hacking/) to make [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) always use the provided monocle layout symbol -- regardless of the number of windows assigned to the current tag. Given the simplicity of the patch, it is unlikey to require manual patching.

This could be trivially expanded to allow the monocle layout symbol to use the number of windows assigned to the current tag, however, the patch provides the behaviour I desire as-is.
